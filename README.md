# Coder-and-decoder-of-labelled-polyomino
The object of this paper is to present algorithms - coder and decoder. Coder's input consists of: code, sequence and merging function and the result of this algorithm is catenation .Decoder's input consists of: encoded sequence, code and merging function and the results of this algorithm is list of directed figures.
